# Detection-of-Kidney-Stones-using-Image-Processing
This project utilizes a computational approach to automate Kidney Stone detection process using image processing techniques. Implemented using Pycharm community edition with libraries such as NumPy and OpenCV, the system integrates sophisticated algorithms to preprocess and analyze medical images.

<h1>things to check to ensure smooth running of program</h1>
<br>

1. python and Pycharm must be installed on laptop. create a virtual environment(venv) by selecting configure interpreter.
<br>

2. make sure that the structure of your files is like so...
Detection-of-Kidney-Stones-using-Image-Processing-main/
├── app.py
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
├── static/
│   └── (your static files like CSS, JS, images)
└── venv/
    └── (virtual environment files)
<br>

3.install all the necessary packages(opencv or cv2, numpy, flask) after placing all the code in the apt locations. click on run and click on the link that you obtain ignore the red warnings given before the link.
<br>
if you have run the file properly you will see the below message in the run console--
<br>
